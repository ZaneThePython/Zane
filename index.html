            <p>Dear Zane.org Community,</p>
            
            <p>It is with a heavy heart that I announce the permanent closure of Zane.org. This decision comes after careful consideration of my current circumstances and responsibilities.</p>
            
            <p>Running a social media platform requires significant time, resources, and dedication - more than I can currently provide. While this platform has been an incredible experience, I believe it's important to be honest about my limitations.</p>
            
            <p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who was part of this community. Your contributions, conversations, and support made Zane.org what it was. The memories and connections made here will always be cherished.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for understanding, and thank you for being part of this chapter of my life.</p>
            
            <p>With appreciation,<br>
            Zane</p>
